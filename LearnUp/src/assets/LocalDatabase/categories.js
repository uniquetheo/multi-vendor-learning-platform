They will learn the basics of binary and how computers read 1's and 0's.  Additionally computer engineers learn about memory, registers, microprocessors, and more of the computer hardware. Computer engineers will then share many of their classes with computer scientists where they will learn computer programming. The curriculum will consist of at least learning C and java.  C programming can then be applied to programming hardware like robotic vehicles. After learning different aspects of programming, computer engineers will have an option to take various elective classes that focus on specific aspects of either computer engineering, computer science, or electrical engineering.
